# Semantic UI 101, 102, 103



## Instruction to take this course: 

Formantic UI is the community version of Semantic UI. We internally use the community version as Formantic has more features that Semantic. 

This is the documentation for fomantic - https://fomantic-ui.com/

## Getting started 

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/fomantic-ui@2.8.7/dist/semantic.min.css">
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/fomantic-ui@2.8.7/dist/semantic.min.js"></script>
```
Open a blank html file and add the above lines to it. You now have semantic in your html to play around with. 

## What is expected from you
You need to go though the entire documentation on fomantic ui website and learn each and every example mentioned there. 

Best way to learn:

- Dont just skim though it
- Open a blank html file, load semantic on it and try out all the examples
- Tweek it.. see how it changes. 
- Get yourself familiar with it 
	- familiar about how to implement it
	- familiar about what all options & variations are available on semantic

## Evaluation criterion 

- How fast are you able to implement a particular design
- How fast are you able to recollect and suggest things from semantic that can be used to achieve a particular wireframe module.
