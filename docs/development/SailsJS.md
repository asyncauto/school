Sails is a framework to help you build software faster. 
For a web app to be built from sccratch using NodeJS, we need to define how a lot of things work - handle requests, render pages, define models, etc. The thing is, these are rather repetitive. Once you build this, you end up copying a lot of your code for the next project. But if you are a beginner and haven't done this already, it's going to take a lot of time for you to get to a working web app.

SailsJS has done this for you. It has built on top of nodejs and has integrated with some libraries. All you need to now learn is what have they done and how to make use of it. 

This book will give you a good idea of the capabilities of boilerplate code sailsjs has published:
