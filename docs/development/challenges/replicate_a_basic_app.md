# Replicate a basic app



Defining some terminologies 
**Familiarity**    
- I have used "var a = new Promise()" is different from I understand what promise is and how promise works.  In the later case, when an error happens you will be able to figure out what is going on. In the former case, you will be wondering what went wrong. If you are wondering what went wrong, you don't know enough. If you don't know how it works, you don't know enough. If you can't articulate "why this", "why not some other way", again you don't know enough. 

Expertise: 
- I am the master of this. I can hit any curved ball. 

## What is expected: Familiarity(not expertise) in the following tech stack
- Javascript and its quirks
- Callbacks/ promises,event loops https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ&list=FLpVkS1E1OyaijMq9mwOLzBg&index=49
- Nodejs runtime environment vs client execution environment
- VS code and debugging 
- Git workflow - how open source and other people collaborate using git
- AWS elastic beanstalk
- AWS RDS
- Postgresql - how to work with it. Making raw queries, moving data from one db to another etc.. 
- Logging things to server
- DNS mapping & cloudflare
- Async auto - what it does and how to use it properly
- Redis - 
- Sessions - how does this work
- Authentication - 
- JWT - what and how does this work. 
- Bull - how does queueing work (not yet implemented in sanitiser)
- Waterline - ORM - How to connect to the DB - sails ORM way
- Views - how to server render html the right way
- Semantic UI - how to use this UI framework
- SMS tool - how to use it.
- Email tool - mailgun - what all does it support, how to use it,


Output expected - https://sanitiser-vivek.frameworx.in should be functionally identical to https://sanitiser.frameworx.in  with its own database in production. 

Time constraint - 1 week.
