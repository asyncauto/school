# Semantic mastery


Semantic has predefined modules and elements which can make designing pages much easier. To effectively use semantic  
  
- Map out the elements and modules - know what all exists
- Learn to use the elements together well  

This is where you try out every single option in semantic. 
Challenge definition:
Get yourself familiar with Semantic. You need to be able to use semantic ui to build any front end interaction. 

You will be evaluated based on:
- Your ability to [quickly pick up elements from semantic](semantic/semantic_elements.md)
- Your ability to come up standard patterns
